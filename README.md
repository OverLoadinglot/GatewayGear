This game is an idea for my startup. The main idea of this project is to teach people programming or improve existing skills, i also believe that this will help people relax like in any other games.

<h2>Description</h2>
This game is a real time strategy, that based on code writting for you units, buildings and their interaction with each other. In this game you will study how to optimize your code for more efficient operations, because there you will need to write code for the operation of each building and unit. You also need to think about how to write good code so that it works even without you, because the game continues even if both players are offline.

<h2>Tutorial</h2>
First of all you will meet tutorial that will help you to understand the base syntax of the language and you will always have links to the game documentation. Then if you have problems with the code, you can always contact an experienced player who will answer your question or if you are an experienced player you can help new players with their questions and get a reward.

<h2>Game modes</h2>
The game will include competitive game modes that will help players both work in a team and deal with tasks on their own. The main aim of all modes is to destroy the opponent's base. So you will be able to play in 1 vs 1 modes or in team-to-team battles, for example, developing each its own base or working with everyone on the development of only one.

<h2>Ranking System</h2>
The game includes a ranking system that will help beginners to play against the same newcomers, and experienced players will be able to fight for awards in the list of the best players. At the beginning of the online game, the player will have to undergo calibration, which will determine his rating.
